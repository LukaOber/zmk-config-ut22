# zmk config for the UT22 keyboard
Essentially a fork of [Bubbleology's repo](https://github.com/Bubbleology/zmk-config-ut22) for the [UT22 keyboard](https://github.com/Bubbleology/UT22).

Changes:
- changed MCU from `nice_nano_v2` to `sparkfun_pro_micro_rp2040`
- defaults to Taipo instead of Artsey.io
- uses sticky keys (a.k.a. one-shot mods) on respective combos instead of needing to hold for the mod
- minor bug fix for allowing more than 16 combos per key (will probably be fixed in the original repo soon)

This repo is a work in progress, use at your own risk.
